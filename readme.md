# Embedded System Projects Portfolio

## Overview

Welcome to my portfolio of successfully completed embedded system projects. These projects represent a significant part of my academic and practical journey, where I had the opportunity to work on various embedded systems, microcontrollers, and sensors. The core technologies I used in these projects include C programming and the STM32 microcontroller platform. Below, you will find a summary of the skills I've acquired throughout my studies.


## Skills and Proficiency

Through these projects, I have developed and honed a range of skills, including:

* C Programming: Proficiency in programming embedded systems in C.
* STM32 Microcontrollers: In-depth knowledge of the STM32 platform and development tools.
* Sensor Integration: Expertise in connecting and calibrating sensors.
* Analog and Digital Data Processing: Ability to handle and process both analog and digital data.
* Communication Protocols: Competence in setting up communication between devices.
P* roblem Solving: Developed a strong analytical and problem-solving mindset.
